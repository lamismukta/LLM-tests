# Integration Summary: Decomposed Algorithmic Pipeline

## ✅ Changes Made

The `decomposed_algorithmic` pipeline is now fully integrated into the repository and will run automatically in all experiments.

### Files Created
1. **`src/pipelines/decomposed_algorithmic.py`** - Core pipeline implementation
2. **`PIPELINE_COMPARISON.md`** - Comprehensive documentation comparing all 4 pipelines

### Files Updated
1. **`src/pipelines/__init__.py`** - Added import and export of DecomposedAlgorithmicPipeline
2. **`run_analysis.py`** - Added pipeline instantiation and CLI support
3. **`config.yaml`** - Enabled decomposed_algorithmic by default
4. **`README.md`** - Updated documentation:
   - Listed decomposed_algorithmic in Features section
   - Added to Project Structure
   - Added usage examples
5. **`QUICKSTART.md`** - Updated CV count in quick test description
6. **`requirements.txt`** - Already had all necessary dependencies

## 🎯 Verification

### Test Import
```bash
python -c "from src.pipelines import DecomposedAlgorithmicPipeline; print('✓ Success')"
# Result: ✓ Success
```

### Test Run
```bash
python run_analysis.py --pipelines decomposed_algorithmic --quick-test
# Result: ✓ Runs successfully
```

### Test in Default Config
```bash
python run_analysis.py --quick-test
# Result: ✓ Runs all 4 pipelines by default
```

---

## 📊 Pipeline Now Available In

### 1. Direct Execution
```bash
# Run only decomposed_algorithmic
python run_analysis.py --pipelines decomposed_algorithmic --quick-test

# Run all pipelines (includes decomposed_algorithmic)
python run_analysis.py --quick-test
```

### 2. Comparison Scripts
All existing analysis tools automatically support the new pipeline:
- `analyze_differences.py` - Shows variance across all pipelines
- `analyze_bias.py` - Includes decomposed_algorithmic in bias analysis
- `visualize_bias.py` - Generates charts including the new pipeline
- `comparison_analysis.py` - Custom comparison scripts

### 3. Results Output
Results for decomposed_algorithmic appear in:
- `results/[experiment]/comparison.csv` - Main results file
- `results/[experiment]/decomposed_algorithmic_*.json` - Detailed results per model
- `results/[experiment]/decomposed_algorithmic_*_rankings.txt` - Human-readable rankings
- `results/[experiment]/summary.json` - Experiment overview
- `results/[experiment]/cv_rankings_pivot.csv` - Pivot table with all pipelines

### 4. Configuration
Enabled by default in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
decomposed_algorithmic:
  description: "Criteria-based with algorithmic aggregation"
  enabled: true
```

To disable (if needed):
```yaml
decomposed_algorithmic:
  enabled: false
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# All 4 pipelines on C and D CVs
python run_analysis.py --quick-test

# All 4 pipelines on A, B, C, and D CVs
python run_analysis.py --extended-test
```

### Bias Comparison
```bash
# Compare multi_layer vs decomposed_algorithmic
python run_analysis.py --pipelines multi_layer decomposed_algorithmic --quick-test --experiment-name bias_test

# Analyze results
python analyze_bias.py bias_test
python visualize_bias.py bias_test
```

### Model Comparison with New Pipeline
```bash
# Test decomposed_algorithmic across all models
python run_analysis.py --pipelines decomposed_algorithmic --models gpt-4o gpt-4o-mini gpt-4-turbo --quick-test
```

## 📈 Expected Behavior

When you run experiments, decomposed_algorithmic will:

1. **Evaluate each CV on 3 criteria** (3 API calls per CV)
   - Zero-to-One Operator
   - Technical T-Shape
   - Recruitment Mastery

2. **Aggregate algorithmically** (no additional API call)
   - Map ratings to scores (Excellent=4, Good=3, Weak=2, Not a Fit=1)
   - Calculate simple average
   - Round to nearest integer

3. **Output consistent rankings**
   - Same criteria evaluations → same final ranking
   - Zero bias from aggregation step
   - Transparent and auditable

---

## 🔧 Maintenance

### If You Need to Modify the Pipeline

Edit `src/pipelines/decomposed_algorithmic.py`:
- `_map_rating_to_score()` - Change rating→score mapping
- `_aggregate_scores()` - Change aggregation method (e.g., add weights)
- `_evaluate_criteria()` - Modify criteria evaluation prompts

### If You Want to Add Weighted Aggregation

```python
# In _aggregate_scores() method, replace:
avg_score = sum(scores) / len(scores)

# With:
weighted_score = (
    scores[0] * 0.4 +  # Zero-to-one (40% weight)
    scores[1] * 0.3 +  # Technical (30% weight)
    scores[2] * 0.3    # Recruitment (30% weight)
)
```
